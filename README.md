## Abstract

This LaTeX Package escapes C-like escape sequences to be shown as plain text rather than LaTeX commands.

## Usage

First, copy `cescapes.sty` into your TeX directory.

```LaTeX
\usepackage{cescapes}
```
provides C-like escape sequences as LaTeX commands except overriding ones of default LaTeX commands.

```LaTeX
\usepackage[override]{cescapes}
```
overrides default LaTeX commands.

## Future work

- Overriding only in particular environments
- Semantic overriding
